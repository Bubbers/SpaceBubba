Super-Bubba-Awesome-Space
=========================

This is a small 3D space-shooter game made during Ludum Dare 34 in our own game-engine called Bubba-3D. Your mission is to destroy 50 of the asteroids in this system. Be aware that you do not have any shields. One hit will destroy you. Use w and S to thrust, A and D to rotate, P and L to change altitude and R to fire the laser.

It's built cross platform but we only provide executable for debian distributions.
